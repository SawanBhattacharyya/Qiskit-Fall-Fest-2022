# Noisy behavior of classification QML algorithm to study the accuracy and precision.
The project had been carried out to investigate the performance of two most popular QML algorithm viz. QSVM and VQC in presence of noise. 
Primarily four classes of noise had been considered viz. Depolarization, Damping, Bit Phase and Phase flip
